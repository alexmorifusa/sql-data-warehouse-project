# Data Warehouse and Analytics Project
## Acknowledgments  
This project was inspired by [Data Engineering Project: Data Warehouse End to End Project using SQL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GVqKuTVANE) on YouTube.

This repository demonstrates the end-to-end process of building a Data Warehouse (DWH) using SQL. The project covers planning, architecture, ETL pipeline development, and data modeling with a layered approach (Bronze → Silver → Gold).

## Project Overview
+ Planned and documented requirements using Notion and Draw.io.
+ Designed a multi-layer data architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold).
+ Implemented ETL pipelines with SQL scripts and stored procedures.
+ Built a Star Schema model for analytics.
+ Version controlled all work with Git.

## Skills and Tools Demonstrated
+ SQL Development: DDL, DML, Stored Procedures
+ Data Warehouse Design: Layered architecture, ETL pipelines
+ Data Modeling: Facts, Dimensions, Star Schema
+ Documentation & Planning: Notion, Draw.io, Git
